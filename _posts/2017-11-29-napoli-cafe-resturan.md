Hungry, I land at *Napoli Cafe & Resturan* on al-Quds Street. Apart from Jerusalem, the road also leads to a very unremarkable hill that has piqued my interest. According to my research, it might harbour dinosaur tracks, like those discovered on a sleepy hilltop west of Jerusalem during the last century. I don't tell Safwat, the owner of the Napoli, any of this. In truth, I've felt like something of a fossil myself in Ramallah.

My European fondness for old things is foreign in this boom town. Its thousands of residents all say they're from Nablus and Jericho, its dozens of ministries all want to be in Jerusalem - and Safwat, who is interrogating me in between incoming phone orders. He never breaks off eye contact. I tell him I'm looking for work. I can write, I'm a designer. "You do social media, man?" I hate social media. I say yes. Am I  hired now?

Business hasn't been great, Safwat complains as I dig into my *pizza vegetables*. He was a chef at fancy Caf√© La Vie in the city center for six years, but now he has his own place, this place, with pizza and sandwiches in both international and [Palestinian versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manakish). His major customers have been employees of the office buildings around the restaurant - mostly banks, each trying to outdo the others in patriotism: Palestine Bank, Wataniya (Homeland) Bank, Al-Quds Bank and Arab Bank.

Safwat's sister picks up the phone, then passes it to Safwat, who was already talking on another phone and talking to me. He writes the order in his book and sets the kitchen in motion: one guy is frying, another receives some shekels to go buy something in the supermarket around the corner. The pandemonium around me deepens my own feelings of inner peace as I finish my pizza. I block out my European sensibilities - the fake plastic grass outside, the garbage plot next door. A garbage-free space is a rarity in this city. A pristine panorama even the prime minister cannot afford. Then again, I doubt the prime minister cares about that sort of thing. I focus on the good stuff: the crisp bell peppers, the fullness of the tomato that you just don't get in the North, and the bustling enthusiasm of the kitchen crew. They all contribute to the genesis of the sandwich order in the Arab way - that is to say, either by performing some action on it or by standing around and discussing the venture to success.

I'm starting to see how the sandwich might not pay off financially, especially when Safwat's nephew mounts his electric bicycle to deliver the single sandwich to the bank. A suffering business? Complaining chef? Rampant inefficiency? High time for me to launch some ideas. In between - sometimes during - Safwat's calls, I hear him out on what his business needs. Facebook? Sure, for who? The businesspeople are all ordering single sandwiches that are just not paying the bills. But here's the good news. The bankers are taking their fond memories of Napoli home and some are ordering family pizzas. And those do satisfy both the palate and the restaurant's bottom line. So how do we get more bankers to order from home? Filled with pride at my first business venture in Palestine, I promise Safwat to take the question home.

The second time I met Hamza was in the evening. We got a Palestinian cocktail from the Palestinian cocktail bar. Containing a cow's daily yield of milkshake, it also featured juice, two bars of chocolate, several types of syrup, sprinkles and candy. I did not opt out of the whipped cream, although the question may have been how much. In any case, my positive attitude was met with approval. We climbed a set of stairs to the park and found two benches at a 90 degree angle to each other. It was pretty cold. Should have said no to the scoop of ice cream. You know, if that was an option.

We sat down and spoke in basic Arabic and basic English. Hamza talked about the time he jumped the Israeli occupation wall to visit Jerusalem and his friend sprained his ankle. I spoke about having a blog, but failed to get the point across. Then we decided to visit the Arafat compound or Muqata3a [^footnote], convieniently located next door. It would have been improper to visit the revered leader with cocktail in hand, alcoholic or not. As I finished the sugary sludge, I see the calorimeter flipping out before my mind's eye.

That was the second time. Today's the third. After president Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the Palestinian Authorities have declared three Days of Rage. The first Day of Rage is to see a demonstration in Ramallah at noon. So here I am, on central Manara roundabout, and here they are too: the same Ramallans I see weaving between cars in the centre or taking their kids to La Vie Cafe. Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine, declares a man on a truck. He has a megaphone. The people listen. It's cold on our Palestinian mountain, just 25 km north of that other city, the city that is dying under the weight of all the symbols people pile onto it.

There's a bunch of Palestinian flags, and one American one. Then, the American one is burned, matter-of-factly and to no screaming or stomping at all. With only Palestinian flags left, it seems the man on the truck has given the signal to march and groups of men and women start moving. After about five phone calls, I finally find Hamza. He has his friends around - of course. I introduce myself to them. The friends look delighted.

So this is a Ramallah demonstration. Looks a lot like the ones back in Brussels. People walk around carrying flags, chants are called and responded to. I never really know what to do with a demonstration. The guys look like they aren't too sure either. We awkwardly walk along to the parade talking about job opportunities as a press photographer and about Marwan's echo pictures that he had to have taken because of a problem with his heart. My lack of language command takes me back to primary school once again. What's your name? Five tomatoes please. Marwan has a heart problem. Marwan points at the marching column and asks, Do you want...? The demonstrators look more serious than most days, but not angry. Days of Seriousness? Sure, I want. Our little group
